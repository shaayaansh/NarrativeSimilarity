In our long term vision is that this could help with cancer detection in resource poor settings. In just speaking about finding your way, what advice would you give to younger women in science about finding their way in this field, and what road blocks would you like to talk about? So I think for me, one of the biggest road blocks was internal. I don't know if you guys have read about the impostor syndrome. I mean , I certainly had that.

Another similarity is the actual hobby/career/medium (whatever you call it) Story A ended up getting into film, and Story B discovered photography which are similar in nature.
